<code style= "color: #f95b39; font-size:12px"> About Me

Hi, my name is Tara Sehdave and I am a senior in highschool. The reason I decided to take AP Computer Science A is because I would like to challenge myself. Although I am not an aspiring software programmer nor an expert in coding, I believe the ability to code is increasingly becoming more relevant and may someday assist me in my future career as a lawyer.
