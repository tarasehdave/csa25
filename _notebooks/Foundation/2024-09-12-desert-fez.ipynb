    "Fez, one of Morocco’s most ancient and culturally significant cities, is often considered the spiritual and intellectual heart of the country. Known for its well-preserved medieval architecture, Fez is home to the world’s oldest continuously operating university, the University of Al Quaraouiyine. The city’s labyrinthine medina, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is famous for its vibrant souls, historic madrasas, and the iconic Bou Inania Madrasa. Fez offers a rich tapestry of Moroccan history and tradition, making it a must-visit destination for travelers interested in the country’s heritage."
