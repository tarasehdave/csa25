    "\n",
    "1. Learn Units #1-#10 from the College Board.\n",
    "2. Build a lesson using Java for each of the topics provided by the teacher’s starters.\n",
    "3. The lesson should include a Tech Talk portion, popcorn hacks, and homework hacks. The lesson should NOT have more than 5 minutes of talking before engaging students in an activity (e.g., popcorn hacks).\n",
    "4. Be prepared to grade homework. This means having a plan for homework and a plan for grading the homework. You will grade on a “1-point” scale. Weight popcorn hacks and homework hacks in the grading.\n",
    "5. Lesson time will be between 20 and 30 minutes. Homework time should be about the same as lesson time.\n",
